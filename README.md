# HTML Portfolio

A simple, accessible, and semantic HTML portfolio website with no CSS or JavaScript.

## Project Structure

```
html-portfolio/
├── index.html          # Home page
├── contact.html        # Contact information page
└── assets/
    └── profile-placeholder.jpg  # Placeholder profile image
```

## Validation Notes

Both HTML files have been validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service. The following warnings may appear but are acceptable:

1. **Section lacks heading** - This warning appears because the validator expects every section to have a heading, but our structure is intentionally simple.
2. **Consider using the h1 element as a top-level heading only** - We're using h1 once per page as the main heading.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser

## Features

## Note About Images

The current image is a placeholder. Replace `assets/profile-placeholder.jpg` with an actual image file for production use.
